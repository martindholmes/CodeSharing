How to use this example implementation of CodeSharing
_____________________________________________________

For details of the CodeSharing API, please open the 
codesharing_protocol.xhtml file in your web browser.

To use the XQuery implementation in eXist:

Requirements: eXist 3.0 or above.

1. Install the XAR file from the release on GitHub,
   or build it yourself using build_release_package.sh
   and install it yourself. This will install the 
   CodeSharing service into eXist. Any application in 
   eXist which has a controller.xql file can be configured
   to provide a CodeSharing interface.

2. Add appropriate stanzas in your the controller.xql 
   file of your eXist application. Customize the 
   example below.
   
   For example, with the following stanzas, a 
   request to "codesharing.htm" will result in the 
   human-friendly web form interface; a request to 
   "codesharing.xhtml" will be answered with the 
   protocol document; and anything else beginning 
   with "codesharing" will generate the xml response
   used by harvesters and other automated processes.
   The following assumes that the codesharing.* files
   are stored in a collection called "codesharing" 
   which is a child of the collection containing 
   controller.xql. Make sure you place these stanzas
   before any other stanzas that might handle generic
   requests for *.html" or similar.
   
       (: TEI CodeSharing API functions. We handle HTML first.  :)
else if (matches($exist:path, '/codesharing\.html')) then
    <dispatch xmlns="http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist">
    	<forward url="/codesharing/codesharing.xql">
    	  <add-parameter name="outputType" value="html"/>
    	  (: This parameter contains the path to the TEI files you wish 
    	     to make queriable with the CodeSharing service. :)
    	  <add-parameter name="rootCol" value="/db/apps/graves/data/xml/original"/>
    	</forward>
    </dispatch>
    
    (: Now we can provide a special case for the HTML protocol description file. :)
    else if (matches($exist:path, '/codesharing_protocol\.xhtml')) then
    <dispatch xmlns="http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist">
    	<forward url="/codesharing/codesharing_protocol.xhtml">
    	</forward>
    </dispatch>
    
(: Now we handle all other cases, to which we respond with XML. This means that e.g. 
  '/codesharing.xml', '/codesharing.xql' or even '/codesharing' will work. :)
else if (matches($exist:path, '/codesharing')) then
    <dispatch xmlns="http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist">
    	<forward url="/codesharing/codesharing.xql">
    	  (: This parameter contains the path to the TEI files you wish 
    	     to make queriable with the CodeSharing service. :)
    	<add-parameter name="rootCol" value="/db/apps/graves/data/xml/original"/>
    	</forward>
    </dispatch>
